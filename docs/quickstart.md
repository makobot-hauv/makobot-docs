# Quick Start

The following guide outlines the steps for building a Makobot HAUV from scratch.


## Parts Acquisition

A complete parts list for the Makobot HAUV is provided on the [Bill of Materials page](bom.md).

Many of the parts specified on this document can be substituted for others depending on your particular project specifications and prior component availability. However, if you are starting from scratch, or want to get the system up and running without spending time modifying sensors and hardware, this parts list will provide a functional vehicle without necessitating excess development and integration time.


#### Notes

Some of the parts on the Bill of Materials can have a lead time of several weeks, so it is best to start parts acquisition as early as possible.

The supplier listed on the Bill of Materials for the Micro Circular wet-pluggable bulkhead cable penetrators and cable pigtails is <a href="http://www.teledynemarine.com/impulse/" target="_blank">Teledyne Impulse</a>, because this is the supplier we have worked with in the past. However, depending on your location and current lead times, you may want to use the Micro Circular wet-pluggable connector series available from <a href="https://www.macartney.com/what-we-offer/systems-and-products/connectors/subconn/subconn-micro-circular-series/" target="_blank">SubConn</a> or <a href="http://seaconworldwide.com/products/electrical-wet-mate/micro-wet-con/" target="_blank">SEACON</a>. All connectors of the same model number should be interchangeable between manufacturers, but we do recommend sourcing all cables and connectors from a single manufacturer if possible for simplicity and guaranteed interchangeability.

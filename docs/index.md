NOTE 3/16/20: These instructions are currently under development and should not yet be used outside of project developers. 

The Makobot Hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (HAUV) is a research platform for autonomous marine robotics research based on the [BlueROV2 from Blue Robotics](https://bluerobotics.com/).

These instructions provide a set of hardware augmentations which can be made to a BlueROV2 in order to provide more capabilities for autonomous operation. We also provide a software stack based on the widely-used robotics framework [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://ros.org/) which provides a starting point for research and development.

# Diver Rig

One of the nicer aspects of the stereo camera integration is the camera modules can be removed from the vehicle and used as a standalone system for data collection by a diver or snorkeler.

This can free up the overhead for deploying the entire vehicle and enable rapid data collection for development and testing.

## Quick Start

1. Purchase the additional parts required for the diver rig listed on the [Bill of Materials](bom.md) page.

2. Manufacture the diver rig chassis plate on the [Manufacturing](mfg.md) page.

3. Assemble the diver rig following the instructions on the [Assembly](assem.md) page.

# Quick Start

The following guide outlines the steps for building a Makobot HAUV from scratch.


## Parts Acquisition

A complete parts list for the Makobot HAUV is provided on the [Bill of Materials page](bom.md).

Many of the parts specified on this document can be substituted for others depending on your particular project specifications and prior component availability. However, if you are starting from scratch, or want to get the system up and running without spending time modifying sensors and hardware, this parts list will provide a functional vehicle without necessitating excess development and integration time.
